<h1>Homework 6.2: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h2>Abby Burris</h2>
<h3>Description of data</h3>
<p>The data describes the population of people in North Carolina by county aged 18 to 24 that have a highschool education or equivalent. The data is from the 2020 census.</p>
<h3>Ratio chosen</h3>
<p>The ratio I chose was to divide the study population (18 to 24 year olds with a college degree or equivalent) by the total population of 18 to 24 year olds. This ratio is done for each of the counties. The ratio is then multiplied by 100 to get a whole number value. </p>

<h2>Natural breaks</h2>
<p>This classification finds the inherent boundaries where there are large differences between two values. A benefit of this classification is that you can use if for classifying data that is not evenly distributed. It finds the largest difference between two classes and the smallest difference within each class. One con of using this classification is that the classes can be heavily influenced by outlier values. Its also not very good at illustrating uniformly distributed data.</p>
